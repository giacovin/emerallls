Vascular Evaluation:

> 33% of DM pts have PAD. 50% of PAD pts are asymptomatic, 50% non classical sx. Claudication only in 10% of PAD. Clinical exam unreliable – non invasive studies needed for definitive dx. 

> Get h&P.  If high risk -> Perfusion test. If + Vascular sx. Risk factors: >65, HTN, DM, Dyslipidemia, obesity, renal dz, tobacco use, family h/o.  High Risk: smoker, 50 yo DM

> Two methods for testing: Macro and Micro: Macro: ABI, TBI, PVR Micro: TCOM, SPP

> ABIs = abnormal <0.8- 0.9 mild (treat risk factors),  0.5-0.8 Moderate (Vas Sx)  <0.5 severe (Vas Sx)

> TBIs = > 70 mmHg or TBI> 0.5 = normal. Anything below PAD Vas Sx Limitations: s/p toe amps

> PVRs = Unaffected by arterial calcification. Morphology test. Waves can be triphasic -mild, biphasic – moderate , monophasic- severe.

> TCOM- Measures oxygen molecules penetration thru the skin as the heating element warm the epidermis. Direct correlation between partial pressure of oxygen and wound healing potential. Normal values are more than 50 mmHg.  Severe PAD at <30 mmHg. Limitations: sensor cannot be used on plantar surface, edematous limbs, dry flaky skin. High margin of error since electrodes sensitive to Temp and humidity. Time consuming 30-45 minutes.

> SPP- laser Doppler sensor + pressure cuff – computerized assessment. Not affected by calcified arteries, edema, dry skin, able to perform in plantar aspects. Normal perfusion > 50 mmHg, 30-50 -> PAD, <30 -> severe PAD. >40mmHg indicator of wound healing potential.
